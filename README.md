# Shell-Workflow-Assessment

This project uses GitHub Actions to implement a CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline is defined in a YAML file located in the .github/workflows directory. It automatically triggers tests on Java code (addition.java) whenever changes are pushed, ensuring code quality and facilitating continuous integration.
